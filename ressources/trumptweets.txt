Tue May 10 16:03:51 CEST 2016 - It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.
Tue May 10 15:57:33 CEST 2016 - It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me, not Crooked Hillary! @marthamaccallum
Tue May 10 14:57:08 CEST 2016 - Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!

Mon May 09 19:21:21 CEST 2016 - I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!
Mon May 09 18:59:00 CEST 2016 - I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!
Mon May 09 18:57:46 CEST 2016 - If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!
Mon May 09 18:56:36 CEST 2016 - Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beat—she had one!

Sat May 07 04:44:54 CEST 2016 - Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
Sat May 07 04:44:44 CEST 2016 - Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
Sat May 07 02:16:31 CEST 2016 - Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
Sat May 07 02:14:54 CEST 2016 - Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
Sat May 07 01:16:36 CEST 2016 - Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
Sat May 07 01:16:17 CEST 2016 - Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!
Sat May 07 01:15:58 CEST 2016 - I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.

Fri May 06 20:03:34 CEST 2016 - Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!
Fri May 06 18:08:23 CEST 2016 - Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
Fri May 06 14:38:38 CEST 2016 - Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!
Fri May 06 14:08:37 CEST 2016 - Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!

Tue Apr 26 12:42:39 CEST 2016 - The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!

Mon Apr 25 18:15:58 CEST 2016 - Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
Mon Apr 25 13:59:06 CEST 2016 - Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Mon Apr 25 13:54:21 CEST 2016 - Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
Mon Apr 25 05:49:17 CEST 2016 - Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
Mon Apr 25 05:39:58 CEST 2016 - Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!

Tue Mar 15 17:16:16 CET 2016 - I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.
Tue Mar 15 17:03:57 CET 2016 - In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
Tue Mar 15 16:03:34 CET 2016 - Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
Tue Mar 15 15:53:41 CET 2016 - Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.

Tue Mar 15 11:39:06 CET 2016 - Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!

Thu Feb 18 13:26:46 CET 2016 - New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!
Thu Feb 18 12:25:40 CET 2016 - I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thu Feb 18 11:53:34 CET 2016 - The just out USA Today National Poll, where I lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, I beat both Hillary and Bernie.
Thu Feb 18 11:44:28 CET 2016 - Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.

Wed Feb 17 17:11:24 CET 2016 - Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!
Wed Feb 17 17:10:30 CET 2016 - Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @LindseyGrahamSC, and just go home.
Wed Feb 17 15:49:02 CET 2016 - .@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!
Wed Feb 17 15:40:24 CET 2016 - I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?
Wed Feb 17 15:39:52 CET 2016 - .@lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews.
Wed Feb 17 12:08:15 CET 2016 - Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!

Mon Feb 15 15:04:31 CET 2016 - Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!

Mon Feb 15 13:24:00 CET 2016 - Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada

Sun Feb 14 23:02:19 CET 2016 - Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!

Wed Feb 03 21:44:28 CET 2016 - Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies."
Wed Feb 03 21:22:46 CET 2016 - Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
Wed Feb 03 20:25:08 CET 2016 - The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
Wed Feb 03 20:20:55 CET 2016 - This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud https://t.co/tRM7KUCrSU

Wed Feb 03 15:28:59 CET 2016 - Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
Wed Feb 03 15:21:03 CET 2016 - And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
Wed Feb 03 15:10:53 CET 2016 - The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
Wed Feb 03 15:07:25 CET 2016 - Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
Wed Feb 03 14:56:48 CET 2016 - During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
Wed Feb 03 14:47:33 CET 2016 - Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

Tue Feb 02 17:29:05 CET 2016 - The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
Tue Feb 02 17:14:24 CET 2016 - Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor
Tue Feb 02 17:03:21 CET 2016 - My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice

Sun Jan 31 15:22:35 CET 2016 - Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies!
Sun Jan 31 14:16:37 CET 2016 - Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam!
